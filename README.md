# Bridge Worker Platform
A general platform working as a service multiplexer to call different services based on sqs msg

Set-up:
In your home directory, add a file BridgeWorkerPlatform.conf and add
* any other local overrides

To run a full build (including compile, unit tests, findbugs, and jacoco test coverage), run:
mvn verify

(A full build takes about 1 min 15 seconds on my laptop, from a clean workspace.)

To just run findbugs, run:
mvn compile findbugs:check

To run findbugs and get a friendly GUI to read about the bugs, run:
mvn compile findbugs:findbugs findbugs:gui

To run jacoco coverage reports and checks, run:
mvn test jacoco:report jacoco:check

Jacoco report will be in target/site/jacoco/index.html

To run this locally, run
mvn spring-boot:run
